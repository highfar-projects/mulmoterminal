// GET /api/files/page/<cwd>/<path> — an HTML file rendered in the Files pane's Preview (#2269).
//
// Two rules, each borrowed rather than invented, because this route serves file bytes:
//   - WHERE: the base is authorised exactly as the raw route's is (the workspace root or a live
//     session's directory), and the path is contained in it with the same gate. So this reaches
//     nothing /api/files/raw does not — it only changes how an HTML file is served.
//   - HOW: an HTML file goes out under the presentHtml preview CSP (`sendHtmlDocument`), which
//     gives the page an opaque origin and no network. Anything else under the page's directory —
//     the image it links relatively — is handed to the raw route, which already serves it with the
//     right type, the sandbox and Range support; one implementation of that, not two.

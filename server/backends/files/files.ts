// Raw file serving — GET /api/files/raw?path=<rel>[&cwd=<session dir>].
//
// Consumers: the collection plugin's image/file fields (the binding's imageSrc maps
// here) and its custom views, whose LLM-authored HTML builds
// `<img src="<origin>/api/files/raw?path=...">` for poster/thumbnail fields; and the
// terminal's clickable file-path links, which pass the session's cwd so a path an agent
// printed inside its own project (possibly a sibling repo outside the workspace root)
// resolves. Mirrors MulmoClaude's server/api/routes/files.ts GET /files/raw (the path the
// gallery view hardcodes), trimmed to what MulmoTerminal needs.
//
// Security (this serves arbitrary files under a base dir):
//   - Base: the workspace root by default, or the `?cwd=` dir when given — but only if
//     that cwd is the root or a live session's directory (`deps.sessionCwds`), never an
//     arbitrary absolute dir from the query. The `path` is then contained within that
//     base — tilde-expanded, then rejected on `..` / absolute / symlink escape.
//   - `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` + `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` so an
//     `.svg`/`.html` with embedded JS can't run in the app origin via direct
//     navigation or <iframe>; PDFs skip the sandbox CSP (WebKit refuses to render
//     sandbox-opaque PDFs) but keep nosniff, and so do audio / video (Chrome's media page
//     cannot fetch the file from the sandbox's opaque origin, so it never plays). The PDF rule
//     matches MulmoClaude's RAW_SECURITY_HEADERS; the media one is ours — see rawServingPlan.

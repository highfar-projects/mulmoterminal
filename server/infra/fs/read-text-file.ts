// Reading a file a HUMAN may have edited, which on Windows means one that may start with a
// byte-order mark.
//
// Notepad, `Set-Content` and PowerShell 5.1's `Out-File -Encoding utf8` all write UTF-8 WITH a
// BOM, and node's "utf8" decoding keeps it as a leading U+FEFF. `JSON.parse` then throws on
// the very first character, and every config reader here answers a throw the same way — with
// an empty config — so the whole file goes silently missing: a directory's colours, a
// provider's registration, the Run menu's scripts. Nothing says why.
//
// The rule already existed for SKILL.md frontmatter (backends/remoteHost/skills.ts) and for
// wiki pages (src/wikiMarkdown.ts); this is the same rule where the JSON readers can reach it.

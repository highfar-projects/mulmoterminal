// The SPA-fallback matcher for vue-router history mode. index.html is served for any
// client-side route — i.e. everything EXCEPT the /api prefix, which is where every
// server HTTP endpoint (including the GUI MCP route) lives. WebSocket upgrades
// (/ws, /ws/run, /ws/pubsub) bypass Express via server.on("upgrade"), and static
// assets are served by express.static before this runs — so reserving /api alone is
// enough. A GET to an unknown /api path is excluded here and falls through to a 404
// (never the SPA shell), so a mistyped API path fails loudly instead of returning HTML.
//
// Express 5 / path-to-regexp v8: app.get("*") is invalid — a RegExp route is used.
// The lookahead reserves the WHOLE /api prefix — both /api/... and the bare /api —
// so even a mistyped bare /api 404s rather than returning the SPA shell.

 *  The `root` option is the whole point (#954). Without it `send` runs its dotfile check over
 *  the ABSOLUTE path, and the default `dotfiles: "ignore"` answers 404 for any install whose
 *  path contains a dot segment — which every `npx` run does, since the package is expanded
 *  under `~/.npm/_npx/`. With a root, only what sits BELOW it is examined, so where the app
 *  happens to be installed stops mattering. The `express.static` above already passes one,
 *  which is why the assets loaded and only the deep link 404'd.
 *
 *  Mounted as a function so a test can drive the real thing on a bare app: mountAppRoutes wants
 *  a dependency object the size of the server, and the spec that existed checked the route
 *  PATTERN only — it stayed green through the whole bug. */

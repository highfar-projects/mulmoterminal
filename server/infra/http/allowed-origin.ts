// Which browser origins may open this server's sockets and reach its privileged routes.
//
// Loopback always, so a malicious website the user happens to visit can't drive the local Claude
// PTY (a cross-site WebSocket hijack). A MISSING Origin is allowed when the peer is on this
// machine — that is a non-browser local client (CLI, MCP tool, curl), which cannot be a
// cross-site request. Any localhost host on any port is allowed, which is what covers the Vite
// dev proxy.
//
// The peer check matters because "it must be local" used to be inferred from the bind address
// alone. Nothing enforced that, and the server in fact listened on every interface, so a remote
// client sending no Origin was trusted outright.
//
// Beyond loopback, the allowed origins are the ones the OPERATOR NAMED — the bind address when
// `MULMOTERMINAL_HOST` gives a specific one, plus `MULMOTERMINAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (#956). Until
// that, widening the bind refused the browser the same operator had just pointed at the same
// address, while a non-browser sending `Origin: http://localhost` was waved through: the honest
// user was the only one stopped. Origin is a header only BROWSERS are held to, so once the
// operator has decided to trust whoever can reach the port, refusing their browser protects
// nobody.
//
// Deliberately NOT "reflect whatever Host the request carried", which is the obvious shortcut and
// is wrong: a DNS-rebinding page sends `Origin: http://evil.com` with a Host that agrees with it,
// so the two match and the check passes. A list the operator wrote cannot be rebound onto.
//
// Out of index.ts because every route module and the pub/sub socket take this as a
// dependency and every one of their tests passes a stub, so the real predicate — the single
// thing standing between a visited page and the user's terminal — was the one piece nothing
// exercised (#548).
//
// `hostname` is what `new URL()` normalises to, so an IPv6 literal arrives bracketed
// (`[::1]`) however it was written, and a host is already lower-cased and punycoded.

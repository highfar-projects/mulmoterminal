// into a wider bind, or any proxy in front, breaks the assumption silently. Asking the socket
// is the only answer that stays true either way.
//
// Node reports an IPv4 peer on a dual-stack listener as `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, so the mapped
// form is unwrapped before comparing: matching the bare literals alone would classify a real
// loopback client as remote. The whole 127.0.0.0/8 block is loopback, not just 127.0.0.1.

// somewhere else entirely by a hosts file. Asking after the fact answers all of them, because

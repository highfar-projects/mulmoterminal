// A cursor session's own record of itself: the per-directory chat list the launcher's "or resume
// here" offers, and the existence probe the survivor guard asks.
//
// Cursor keeps chats under `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/<chatId>/<chatId>.jsonl`,
// where `<slug>` is derived from the working directory — and NOT derivably: long paths are
// truncated and suffixed with a hash (`…-mulmotermina-e83f160`), so reconstructing one from a cwd
// means reimplementing an undocumented rule that will rot. The directory records its own path
// instead, in `.workspace-trusted`, and that file is what this module reads.
//
// It is not written for every project directory — measured, the three directories with no chats had
// none — but every directory that HAD chats had one. That correlation is what makes this safe
// rather than merely convenient: a project directory we cannot attribute is OMITTED, so the failure
// mode is "nothing to resume here", never another directory's conversations.
//
// CURSOR ITSELF SCOPES CHATS BY DIRECTORY. Measured: resuming a chat id belonging to another
// directory starts an EMPTY conversation rather than that directory's — asked what shell command it
// had been given earlier, it answered that this was the first message. So the cwd-bound probe below
// is defence in depth rather than the only thing standing between a hand-edited `?session=` and
// another project's history, which is what it is for copilot.

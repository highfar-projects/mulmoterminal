// `~/.copilot/session-store.db` — with the working directory recorded per row, so the listing is a
// query and not a directory walk (muse-session.ts has the same shape for the same reason).
//
// The existence probe does NOT go through sqlite. A session's data also lands in
// `session-state/<id>/`, and a directory test is synchronous, cheap, and true the moment the
// session starts — where the index row's `updated_at` is written "periodically during a session,
// and also when the session ends". The survivor guard runs once per reconnect burst across every
// surviving cell, so the cheap answer is the right one there.

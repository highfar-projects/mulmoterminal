// The Files pane tree's own file operations (#2578): a new file or folder, a rename, and a delete
// that moves the entry to the system Trash rather than destroying it.
//
// Every one acts on the ENTRY the tree shows — a symlink is renamed or trashed as a link, never
// followed — and inside the pane's root: the path is contained lexically, its parent directory is
// contained through symlinks, and the root itself is never an entry. A rename keeps the entry in its
// directory; moving between directories is not offered.
//
// Deleting is offered only where the Trash is known: macOS's `~/.Trash`, and the freedesktop Trash on
// Linux. Elsewhere there is no delete at all, rather than a delete that cannot be undone.

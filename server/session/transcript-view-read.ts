// THE AGENT IS NOT ASKED. That is the constraint the whole shape follows from, and it predates the
// second reader: a claude session that outlived a server restart reports its agent as `shell`,
// because a claude pane's `pane_current_command` is a version string (`2.1.233`) that
// `agentFromPaneCommand` has no entry for. A reader chosen by `agentOfSession` would therefore lose
// the conversation view on every restarted claude cell — the exact regression this file's original
// comment warned about.
//
// So each source is asked whether IT has a file for this (cwd, id), in order, and the first that
// does answers. That is the generalisation of what one reader already did by asking for
// `<id>.jsonl`: file existence is a fact, and the agent is a guess.
//
// Claude is first because it is the cheapest question (one path join) and the common case. A source
// whose `locate` is expensive belongs later in the list.
//
// THREE of the four keep a FILE and one keeps a TABLE, which is why this is a union rather than one
// shape. A file source is read by locating it and folding a byte window off its tail; copilot has no
// file to locate and no tail to read — its window is `ORDER BY turn_index DESC LIMIT n`. What the
// two have in common is the SCAN, so that is where they meet: both hand the same `TranscriptScan` to
// the same `transcriptViewOf`, and the budget, the byte cap and the eviction rule are shared by

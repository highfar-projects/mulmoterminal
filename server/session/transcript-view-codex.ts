// A codex rollout, folded into the same turns the phone already reads for claude (#1822).
//
// The SHAPE of the view is claude's and is not re-decided here: turns opened by a user prompt,
// rows of `user` / `assistant` / `tool` / `unknown`, the line budget, the byte cap, the eviction
// rule. All of that lives in transcript-view.ts and is shared. What is codex's own — and what had
// to be measured rather than assumed — is which record means what.
//
// MEASURED over 500 randomly sampled rollouts of the 6,905 on this machine — `response_item`
// payload types, with the number of those 500 files each appears in:
//
//   function_call            7,900   286 files   a tool call: `name` + `arguments`
//   function_call_output     7,900   286 files   its result
//   reasoning                6,172   489 files   `summary: []`, body encrypted — nothing readable
//   message                  5,205   500 files   role: assistant / user / developer
//   custom_tool_call         2,898   260 files   a tool call: `name` + `input`
//   custom_tool_call_output  2,898   260 files   its result
//   web_search_call             15    10 files   `action: { type, url | query }`
//   tool_search_call / _output   3     3 files   a tool-catalogue search
//
// FOUR TRAPS, each of which produces a plausible-looking wrong view. The first two were found by
// sampling one rollout; the last two only by counting the store, and the fourth was invisible until
// the third was fixed:
//
//   1. A `role: "user"` message is usually NOT the person — it is codex's own preamble
//      (`<recommended_plugins>`, `<environment_context>`). The boundary rule is `codexUserTurn`
//      (codex-user-turn.ts), measured over all 6,334 rollouts and already serving three readers.
//      A fresh "has a user message" predicate fuses every exchange into one turn the budget can
//      never evict.
//   2. ONE prompt can be written TWICE — a `response_item` immediately followed by an `event_msg`
//      with identical text (924 such pairs in the store). `isDoubleWrite` drops the second.
//   3. THERE ARE TWO TOOL FAMILIES, not one. `custom_tool_call` carries `exec` and `apply_patch`
//      and appears in **52% of rollouts** — more than half the store. A renderer that knows only
//      `function_call` shows the prompt and the prose and silently omits the commands, which is a
//      conversation with its work cut out of it (Codex review, round 1).
//   4. AND THE OUTPUT FIELD IS TWO SHAPES, in BOTH families. Over 800 rollouts:
//      `function_call_output` is a string 12,580 times and an ARRAY 88 times;
//      `custom_tool_call_output` is an array 4,486 times and a string 269 times. A reader that
//      handles one shape per family drops the other — the original `function_call` handler was
//      already dropping those 88 before this file grew a second family to get wrong.
//
// SO THE RULE IS BY SHAPE, NOT BY NAME. Every payload type ending `_call` or `_output` is a tool
// record by construction, and an unrecognised one renders a row saying so rather than nothing. That
// is claude's `unknown` block rule applied to the record axis, and it is scoped to those two
// suffixes for the reason the earlier version of this comment gave for having no fallback at all:
// codex adds NON-tool record types routinely (`world_state`, `turn_context`, `session_meta`), and a
// row per unknown type would fill the view with names of things that are not conversation. Nothing
// in the store hits the fallback today — it is a tripwire, not a source of rows.

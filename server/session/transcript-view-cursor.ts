// A cursor chat, folded into the same turns the phone already reads for claude and codex (#1822).
//
// The SHAPE of the view is claude's and is not re-decided here — turns, row kinds, the line budget,
// the byte cap, the eviction rule all live in transcript-view.ts. What is cursor's own is which
// record means what, and that was measured rather than assumed.
//
// MEASURED over EVERY cursor transcript on this machine — all 35 of
// `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/<id>/<id>.jsonl`. The whole store, not a sample:
//
//   record kinds          role: assistant  57 (34 files) · role: user  40 (35 files)
//                         type: turn_ended 34 (34 files)
//   content parts         assistant/text  48 · user/text  40 · assistant/tool_use  19
//
// Three things follow, and the third is a limitation to state rather than a rule to write:
//
//   1. THE PROMPT IS WRAPPED. A user record's text arrives as
//      `<timestamp>…</timestamp>\n<user_query>…</user_query>`, and cursor does NOT escape the
//      marker — a prompt containing the literal text `</user_query>` is stored verbatim inside the
//      wrapper (measured in #2072). `cursorUserText` unwraps first-open-to-LAST-close for that
//      reason, and it is shared with the conversation list's titles rather than copied.
//   2. `tool_use.input` IS AN OBJECT, not a string. Codex's two families both carry their arguments
//      as a string; cursor's is `{ command, description }`. So the call row serialises it rather
//      than printing it, and the same CALL_ARGS cap applies to the result.
//   3. THERE ARE NO TOOL RESULTS IN THE TRANSCRIPT AT ALL. Not a part type that renders nothing —
//      absent. Zero `tool_result` parts and zero result records across the whole store. So a cursor
//      turn shows what was asked, what was said, and WHICH tools ran, but never what they answered.
//      That is cursor's file, not a gap in this reader, and it is the one way a cursor turn reads
//      thinner than a claude or codex one.
//
// AND THE STORE IS SMALL — 35 transcripts, most of them this project's own probes, against codex's
// 6,905. The confidence that "these are the only part types" is correspondingly weaker, which is
// why an unrecognised content block renders an `unknown` ROW rather than nothing. That is claude's
// own rule on the same axis (a content block, not a record type), and here it is load-bearing
// rather than ceremonial: it is what makes a shape this store never showed us VISIBLE instead of
// silently thinning the view.

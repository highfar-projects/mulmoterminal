 *
 * A process that EXITED between the two listings counts for nothing: its last interval is lost.
 * That under-reads a run made of many short-lived children, on purpose. Folding dead children
 * into their parent (`ps -S`) would instead move a long-lived child's WHOLE lifetime into the
 * parent the moment it exits, which this delta then counts a second time — a spike from nothing.
 * Reading low is the safer failure for a picture.

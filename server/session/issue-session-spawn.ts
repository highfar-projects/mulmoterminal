// The session an issue's work starts in, for whichever agent was asked for (#2228).

// An issue session is a PROJECT cell: it runs in the issue's worktree and takes its GUI tools from
// what that directory registered, the way a cell opened there would — not the full toolset a
// GUI-started chat gets, which is why spawnSeededSession is not reused as it stands. What each
// agent needs to get there differs (codex and copilot take a flag, cursor's file has to be written
// and approved first), so each has its own entry, kept in step with its cell in ws-routes.ts.

// What the launcher does about a server child that just exited: bring it back, stop, or report a
// taken port. The production half of the decision scripts/dev-server-config.js makes for `yarn dev`.
//
// `yarn dev` has restarted the backend on any exit since #734; the shipped launcher exited with
// it. So the developer was protected from a crash and the user was not — and the user is the one
// who cannot fix it, because their sessions are tmux-backed and still alive while the only thing
// that serves them is gone. From a phone there is no way back at all (#2162).
//
// WHY NOT `restartPlan` FROM scripts/. Two reasons, and either is enough:
//   - `scripts/` is not in package.json's `files`, so an import of it from here resolves in the
//     repo and ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUNDs for everyone who installed the package.
//   - the policy differs. Dev retries EVERY exit forever because a file save is how the developer
//     fixes whatever was wrong. There is no watcher here, and there are exits dev never sees.
//
// Pure on purpose: the rule is the whole risk, and it is reachable only by killing a real server
// otherwise. Nothing here reads a clock, a socket or a process.

 * runs — bin/stop.js says so in its own note. The server therefore never reaches the `exit(0)`
 * that means "somebody asked for this", and the exit arrives as a bare non-zero code with no
 * signal: the exact shape of the crash this module exists to recover from. Restarting on it would
 * resurrect a server the user just stopped, and leave them no way to stop it at all.
 *
 * So Windows keeps the behaviour it had before supervision existed — the launcher leaves with its
 * server — and says nothing new about it. Fixing it properly means giving `stop` a way to reach
 * the LAUNCHER rather than only the server it spawned, which is a change to the instance registry
 * and to `stop` itself, not to this decision.

 * serving, so there is no browser session to bring back, and the same boot fails the same way.
 * That is what keeps a bad config, or a half-unpacked npx cache, from being respawned, and keeps
 * the launcher's npx-cache hint at the end of the output rather than under repeats of one stack.
 *
 * `consecutiveFailures` counts failures in a row and INCLUDES the exit being judged, so 1 is the
 * first. It resets when the server says it is listening — deliberately not on elapsed time: the
 * server does its whole setup before it binds, so "it stayed up N seconds" read every crash as a
 * one-off and the backoff never fired (#1735).
 *
 * `platform` is asked for rather than read from `process` so that a run on one platform can decide
 * about another — and so that nothing here depends on ambient state.

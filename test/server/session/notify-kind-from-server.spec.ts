// What the beep DOES, driven by what the server actually publishes.
//
// It lives under test/server/ despite testing a src/ module: notifyKind.ts is pure TypeScript
// with no DOM in it, so it runs under node, and importing the server's rules into the app's
// test project would pull @types/node into a browser program (which retypes window.setTimeout
// and breaks unrelated components).
//
// notifyKind.spec.ts checks the decision against rows written by hand, which is only ever as
// right as the author's memory of the server. This file removes that gap: it runs the real
// server rules (activityHookEffects deciding the flag changes, nextActivity deciding which of
// them publish at all) and feeds their output to the real client decision.
//
// It exists because of a regression that shipped past hand-written rows. A background Stop
// applies { waiting: true } then { working: false }; the second publishes NOTHING when the
// working flag was already false, and a decision keyed on that flag dropping made exactly
// those turns silent. The bug was invisible in a test that hand-wrote both rows, because the
// author wrote the row the server would not have sent.
//
// A turn that ends must make exactly ONE sound — never two (eight parallel sessions is what
// made #873 a problem in the first place) and never zero.

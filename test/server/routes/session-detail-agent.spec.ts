// `?agent=` already decided where the two header badges come from (#1465); `lastPrompt` and
// `lastResponse` were read from claude's per-project transcript whatever it said. A codex session
// has no file there — codex mints its own id and writes a rollout under $CODEX_HOME — so the route
// answered nulls and the cockpit roster's `prompt` and `reply` lines were blank for every codex
// cell while the claude cell beside it was filled. (The `summary` line is claude's own `ai-title`,
// which codex writes nowhere; it stays empty and is not what this fixes.)
//
// Pinned at the ROUTE rather than at `sessionLastTurn`, which had the branch all along: what was
// broken is that this handler never asked it.

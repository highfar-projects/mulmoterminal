// @vitest-environment node
//
// WHICH DIRECTORY a route that is ABOUT one session answers about, when the request names none
// (#2133).
//
// `?cwd=` was optional and defaulted to the workspace, which is right for a route reporting on a
// DIRECTORY and wrong for every route reporting on a SESSION: a session runs where it runs, and
// most of the stores these routes read are partitioned by directory — claude's transcript sits
// under a slug derived from the cwd, and grok's, cursor's, copilot's and muse's are scoped by it
// too. So a caller that sent no `cwd` was answered out of a different project's files.
//
// The caller that does exactly that is the collection chat pane (`useSessionSummary.ts`): it knows
// the session and its agent and has no directory to send — the chat is filed under a collection,
// not under a path — so its supervision line was read from the workspace and came back blank.
//
// The decoy is what makes this a measurement rather than a smoke test: the SAME session id has a
// transcript under both directories, with different words in it. Before the fix a no-cwd request
// answered with the decoy's; a test whose workspace held nothing could not tell "read the right
// file" from "read no file".
//
// One agent is enough here even though seven are hosted: the directory is resolved once, before
// any agent branch, so this pins the resolution and `session-detail-agent.spec.ts` pins the
// branch. Claude is the sharpest of them — its transcript PATH is derived from the cwd.

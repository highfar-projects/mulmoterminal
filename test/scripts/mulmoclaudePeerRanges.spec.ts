// @vitest-environment node
// Which `@mulmoclaude/core` each bundled package actually runs against.
//
// Nothing here nests its own core, so every package that names one imports the single core
// MulmoTerminal installs. That is what makes them breakable from HERE: a peer range is a
// declaration and yarn only warns, so a host that pins a core older than a package expects
// installs cleanly and fails late — the package keeps importing what it imported, and what
// breaks is the symbol core moved or re-typed, an empty control or an unformatted value in the
// pane rather than an install error. The stamped-`datetime` lock is the live example: it needs
// `isCanonicalServerTime`, and holding collection-plugin behind that left the pane drawing the
// field as an empty `datetime-local` — saving it then wrote over a value the rules refuse to
// see move.
//
// Declaring core as a DEPENDENCY is the way out of that regime, and it is checked directly
// rather than through yarn's output: yarn nests a copy only on a version CONFLICT, so a package
// that moved core to a dependency at the range we already pin would be hoisted, look exactly
// like a peer, and leave the premise silently false.
//
// So this reads what is INSTALLED rather than what package.json asks for: a range resolves to
// one version, and that version is the one that runs.

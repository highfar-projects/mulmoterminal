// Extensions a browser can only ever show as SOURCE — the code, style, config and log
// files a terminal actually prints paths to.
//
// Both sides of the file-path link decide something from this set, and the two decisions
// are different, so this is the shared CORE rather than either side's whole answer:
//   - the server serves these as text/plain so they VIEW instead of downloading
//     (backends/files/rawServingPlan.ts, which also covers docs, markup and dotfiles), and
//   - the client opens these in the app's own Files view instead of a new tab
//     (composables/terminalFilePathLinkProvider.ts, which also covers .txt).
// Each side adds its own extras next to its import; anything that belongs to only one of
// them does NOT belong here.
//
// Adding an extension changes what a clicked path DOES, which is documented — see the DOCS
// block in composables/terminalFilePathLinkProvider.ts for the three files to update (#834).

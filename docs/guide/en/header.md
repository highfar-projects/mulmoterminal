# Customizing the header
{: .no_toc }

- TOC
{:toc}

When the only way to run something is to type it into the terminal, you type it dozens of times a
day. MulmoTerminal lets you put **your own buttons** on the header of a running session: a few lines
of config, and sending `/compact`, running the tests, or opening the team wiki all become one click.

This page starts from **adding your very first button**. The full field reference lives in
[Configuration → customizing the header](config.html#header).

---

## 1. Read the header first {#anatomy}

Here is a cell with nothing configured. The header has two rows.

![The header of a cell with nothing configured](../images/header-default.png)

| Where | What's there | What config changes |
|---|---|---|
| Row 1, left | the status dot and **info chips** like `⎇ main` | [`chips`](header-reference.html#chips) reorders, hides and adds |
| Row 1, right | the **History** and **Tools** menus / set aside / expand / close — **cell actions** | not configurable (app structure) |
| Row 2, left | `~/acme-api ▾` — the **path menu** (below) | not configurable |
| Row 2, right | the **Skill** dropdown and a row of **icon buttons** | [`buttons`](#first-button) lands here |

**The right-hand side of row 2 is what you customize.** Your buttons land to the right of
**Skill** (the lightning-bolt icon); the icons there by default are fixed app controls.

> **There is only one default button** — **Open this branch's PR**, which appears only when the
> branch has an open PR. *Insert a file path*, *Reveal in the file manager*, *Browse files in the
> app*, *New terminal here* and the GitHub links used to be here and have moved into the path menu
> below.

### The path menu — anything to do with the directory {#path-menu}

The path on the left of row 2 (`~/acme-api ▾`) is a button. It opens the actions that apply to this
cell's directory.

![The path menu](../images/header-path-menu.png)

It holds **Insert a file path** (pick a file in the OS dialog; its absolute path is typed at the
prompt), *Reveal in the file manager*, *Browse files in the app* and *New terminal here*, in the UI
language. When the repository's remote is on GitHub, a **GitHub** section follows with
**Repository / Issues / Pull requests / Actions**; on GitLab (gitlab.com, or a host listed in
`gitlabHosts`) it is a **GitLab** section with **Repository / Issues / Merge requests /
Pipelines**. Those keep the forge's own names. This menu is fixed and config does not change it — if you want one of these as a
button too, write it yourself in [`buttons`](#run) and you get both.

---

## 2. Add your first button {#first-button}

**Without writing JSON:** Settings → **Header buttons and chips** adds a button to every terminal —
one that runs a command in a new cell, types text into the agent, opens something (a URL, a folder, a
view of the app, this branch's PR, a file picker) or runs one of the app's named operations — with an
optional icon and condition. The pencil on a row edits that button in place (its id and place stay),
and the others there remove or move it. The folder icon on a row puts that button in a folder — an
existing one or a new one named there; a folder's buttons are listed under it, and one taken out lands
right after the folder (the folder goes with its last button). Everything else is written as below.

### Which file to write in {#where}

| File | Applies to |
|---|---|
| `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` | **every** terminal |
| `<project>/.mulmoterminal.json` | only cells opened **in that directory** |

**Buttons appear on AGENT cells** — every entry in the Agent Picker. A terminal started from
a launcher chip, a Shell cell or a Run command shows none of them: it is your own command line, and
nothing this app configures is added to it.

Starting per-project is the safer experiment. Create `.mulmoterminal.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "buttons": [
    {
      "id": "compact",
      "icon": "compress",
      "label": "Compact this conversation",
      "run": "input",
      "text": "/compact"
    }
  ]
}
```

**No server restart is needed.** The header is re-read when the working directory, session or agent
changes, and **when the browser window regains focus** — so save in your editor, switch to the
browser, and it's there.

### What pressing it does {#what-happens}

`run: "input"` types `/compact` **into the Claude / Codex running in that cell and submits it** —
the same thing you'd do by switching to the terminal and typing, in one click.

### The trap — writing `buttons` replaces the defaults {#replace}

Writing `buttons` **anywhere replaces the whole built-in set** (it is not merged on top). Write only
the example above and **Open this branch's PR** disappears. List it yourself if you want to keep it:

```json
{
  "buttons": [
    { "id": "pr", "icon": "github:git-pull-request", "label": "Open this branch's PR", "run": "open", "when": "isGitRepo", "open": { "pr": true } },
    { "id": "compact", "icon": "compress", "label": "Compact this conversation", "run": "input", "text": "/compact" }
  ]
}
```

---

## 3. Icons and tooltips {#icon-label}

This is what trips people up first.

**`label` is not drawn on screen.** A button renders **only its icon**, and `label` becomes the
**tooltip you get on hover** (the browser's own).

So `label` is your only way to say what a button is. Prefer a phrase that names the action —
**`Run the tests`**, not `Build` — because nobody reads it until they hover.

| Key | Role |
|---|---|
| `icon` | a [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) name (`compress`, `science`, `menu_book`, …), or one of GitHub's own icons: `github:repo`, `github:issue-opened`, `github:git-pull-request`, `github:play`, `github:mark-github` (GitHub's logo). **The only thing drawn** |
| `emoji` | a single emoji; wins over `icon` |
| `label` | **required**. The hover tooltip, and the accessible name (`aria-label`) |

With neither `icon` nor `emoji`, you get `bolt` (a lightning bolt). A row of identical bolts tells
you nothing, so always set `icon`.

Below is a header with five buttons configured. Note that not one of them shows any text.

## 4. The four `run` types {#run}

`run` decides what a button does. There are only four.

### `run: "input"` — send it to the agent {#run-input}

Types `text` into the session and submits it. For slash commands and prompts you repeat.

```json
{ "id": "compact", "icon": "compress", "label": "Compact this conversation", "run": "input", "text": "/compact" }
```

### `run: "shell"` — run a command {#run-shell}

Runs `cmd` in a **command cell**, leaving the agent's session undisturbed.

```json
{ "id": "test", "icon": "science", "label": "Run the tests", "run": "shell", "cmd": "yarn test" }
```

Pressing it opens a cell like this and shows the output:

![The command cell a run:"shell" button opens](../images/header-shell-cell.png)

> `cmd` **never reaches the browser**. On click the server looks it up again by `id`, shell-escapes
> the `${variables}`, and runs that.

### `run: "open"` — open something {#run-open}

**One key** inside `open` decides what opens.

**The table is also the precedence** if you write more than one — highest first.

| Key | Opens |
|---|---|
| `pr` | the current branch's PR in the browser (**the button hides itself when there is no PR**). The server resolves it into `url`, so **it beats an explicit `url` written alongside it** |
| `url` | a URL in the browser (`http` / `https` only) |
| `reveal` | the OS file manager (Finder / Explorer / `xdg-open`) |
| `files` | the in-app file explorer |
| `view` | an in-app view: `prs` / `wiki` / `collections` / `accounting`. (`diff` is accepted but **has no dedicated screen yet and opens the files view** — reach a worktree's diff from [the diff badge](worktree.html#diff-badge) instead) |
| `terminal` | a new terminal cell in that directory |
| `pickFile` | the OS file dialog, inserting the chosen path into the prompt |

```json
{ "id": "handbook", "icon": "menu_book", "label": "Open the team handbook", "run": "open", "open": { "url": "https://example.com/handbook" } }
```

> **Write only one per button.** Set several and **only the first** in that order takes effect; the
> rest are silently ignored.

### `run: "action"` — act on this cell {#run-action}

Acts on the cell itself — or, for the toolbar's operations at the end of the table, on the app. The
names are the [keyboard shortcut](config.html#keymap) names, so the same operation is a button, a
key, and a command-palette entry (the toolbar's are in the palette as its screen, Settings and
choice rows):

| `action` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `"terminal-new-here"` | Open the **launch panel** on this cell's directory — pick Claude, Codex, a shell, … (also the **＋** on row 2) |
| `"terminal-new-adjacent"` | Start a **shell** in this cell's directory at once |
| `"terminal-restart"` | Restart the agent in this cell (below) |
| `"terminal-close"` | Close this cell |
| `"zoom-toggle"` | Enlarge / collapse this cell |
| `"terminal-move-prev"` / `"terminal-move-next"` | Move this cell one place (manual order only) |
| `"mark-unread"` | Mark this cell unread / read |
| `"terminal-park"` | Set this cell aside / wake it |
| `"terminal-timeline"` | The **activity timeline** (Claude sessions only) |
| `"terminal-talk"` | **Talk to another terminal** |
| `"terminal-copy-code"` | **Copy the last code block** of the latest reply (the row-2 copy button) |
| `"terminal-insert-path"` / `"terminal-reveal"` | **Insert a file path** at the prompt / **open the directory** in the file manager (the path menu's items) |
| `"terminal-voice"` | **Voice input** on / off (the mic) |
| `"terminal-diff"` / `"terminal-note"` | Open the **changes panel** (worktree with changes) / write or edit the **note** |
| `"pane-files"` | The **files pane** beside this cell |
| `"pane-prompts"` / `"pane-transcript"` | The **prompts you sent** / the **conversation** pane |
| `"pane-tools"` / `"pane-canvas"` / `"pane-collections"` | The **tools used** / **Canvas** / **Collections** pane |
| `"screen-wiki"`, `"screen-collections"`, … (every `screen-*`) | **Go to that screen** — the toolbar's doors |
| `"settings-open"` / `"sound-toggle"` / `"view-toggle"` | Open Settings / notification sound on-off / enlarged view roster-strip |
| `"order-auto"` / `"order-manual"` / `"order-priority"` | Set the cell order |
| `"page-next"` / `"page-prev"` | Next / previous page of the grid |
| `"terminal-reopen"` | Reopen the terminal closed most recently |

A pane button toggles its pane on the enlarged cell. On a tiled cell it enlarges the cell and opens
the pane, as *Browse files in the app* does. When the cell cannot do it — `terminal-timeline` on a
non-Claude session, `terminal-talk` with no other terminal, a move outside manual order — the cell
says so instead of doing nothing. `"restart"`, the name before the shortcut names were shared, still
works.

```json
{ "id": "restart", "icon": "restart_alt", "label": "Restart the agent", "run": "action", "action": "terminal-restart" }
```

`"terminal-restart"` ends the agent process and starts it again **in the same cell, in the same directory, on
the same conversation** — no going back to the launcher to pick the directory and hunt for the
session in *or resume here*. This is what makes a changed MCP registration, an edited
`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` or an updated plugin take effect: those are read once, when the
process starts.

> **It costs a resume, and it asks nothing first.** The conversation is read back from its
> transcript, which costs real tokens, and the agent is killed even mid-turn. Besides this button, the
> cell's Tools menu and the [`terminal-restart` shortcut](config.html#keymap) restart it.

### Group buttons into a folder {#folder}

Row 2 has only so much room. Put several occasional buttons in one **folder**: an entry with
`items` instead of `run`. It shows as one icon, and pressing it opens a menu listing each button
with its icon and label.

```json
{ "id": "ops", "icon": "construction", "label": "Operations",
  "items": [
    { "id": "restart", "icon": "restart_alt", "label": "Restart the agent", "run": "action", "action": "terminal-restart" },
    { "id": "test", "icon": "science", "label": "Run the tests", "run": "shell", "cmd": "yarn test" }
  ] }
```

- **One level only.** An entry inside `items` must be a button; a folder inside a folder is dropped.
- The folder's own `when` hides the whole folder; each button inside keeps its own `when`. A folder
  whose buttons are all hidden is not shown at all.
- Ids stay unique across folders and plain buttons — a button inside a folder that repeats an id
  already used is dropped.

### Commands for the command palette only {#commands}

Something you run now and then does not need an icon on every header. Write it under **`commands`**
instead of `buttons` — **exactly the same shape** (`run`, `when`, `${variables}`, folders) — and it
appears only in the **command palette** (the toolbar's Commands button, or your `command-palette` key).

```json
{ "commands": [
    { "id": "release", "label": "Cut a release", "run": "shell", "cmd": "yarn release" }
  ] }
```

- It works in both files, `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` and the project's `.mulmoterminal.json`,
  merged by id like buttons.
- The palette lists the commands **and every header button** of the terminal it acts on: the
  enlarged one, or the one holding the cursor. `when` and `${variables}` resolve for that terminal,
  and a `shell` command runs there. With no terminal to act on, none are listed.
- A command cannot take an id a button already has; it is dropped.

---

## 5. From here on, look it up {#next}

You can build a button now. Everything past this point — the `${variables}`, every `when` form, how
the global and project files merge, chips, the Skill menu, and recipes to paste — lives in the
**[header reference](header-reference.html)**. That page is not meant to be read top to bottom; it
is meant to be **looked up while you write**.

| What you want | Where |
|---|---|
| what `${dir}` or `${task}` holds, and when it is empty | [`${variables}`](header-reference.html#vars) |
| the conditions (`!isGitRepo`, `!=`, "has a value") | [`when`](header-reference.html#when) |
| how the global and project files combine | [ordering and merging](header-reference.html#order-merge) |
| reordering and adding the row-1 info chips | [chips](header-reference.html#chips) |
| shortening the Skill menu | [the Skill menu](header-reference.html#skills) |
| a whole `.mulmoterminal.json` to paste | [recipes](header-reference.html#recipes) |

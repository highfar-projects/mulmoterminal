# Run the server on another machine

MulmoTerminal is one server (Express, the terminals, tmux and the agents' CLIs) and a web page it
serves. The server does not have to run on the machine your browser is on: put it on a Linux box, a
VPS or a container, and reach it from your laptop through an **SSH tunnel**. The agents then run —
and keep running — over there.

This is a **first cut**. It has been run end to end once (a Linux container, reached through
`ssh -L`), and the parts nobody has tried yet are marked as such below. If you use it, please say
how it went on [issue #2669](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/issues/2669) — that is how
the next version gets decided.

## Why a tunnel, and not an open port

The server has **no login**. It listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing outside the machine can
reach it. An SSH tunnel keeps it that way: your laptop's `localhost:34567` is carried to the
server's `127.0.0.1:34567` over SSH, and to the server the connection comes from itself. Nothing
has to be opened in a firewall, and nothing about the server's settings changes.

## On the server

You need what a local install needs ([Getting started](getting-started.html)): Node.js 22.12 or
newer, `git`, `gh`, and the agent CLIs you use (`claude`, `codex`, …). `tmux` is optional but
worth having: with it, terminals survive the server restarting and your laptop disconnecting.

Log in over SSH and start it:

```bash
ssh you@server
npx mulmoterminal@latest
```

Started over SSH, it opens no browser on the server, and prints the tunnel command to run on your
own machine:

```text
[mulmoterminal] Started over SSH, so no browser is opened here. On your own machine, run:
[mulmoterminal]   ssh -N -L 34567:127.0.0.1:34567 you@<this-host>
[mulmoterminal] then open http://localhost:34567 there.
```

To keep it running after you log out, start it inside `tmux` (or `screen`, or a service manager),
and stop it with `npx mulmoterminal stop`.

## On your laptop

```bash
ssh -N -L 34567:127.0.0.1:34567 you@server
```

Then open **http://localhost:34567** in your browser. Close and reopen the tunnel at will: the
terminals keep running on the server, and the page reattaches to them.

- If `34567` is taken on your laptop (a local MulmoTerminal, say), forward another local port:
  `ssh -N -L 34599:127.0.0.1:34567 you@server`, then open `http://localhost:34599`.
- Add **`-A`** (`ssh -A -N -L …`) to let the agents `git push` with the keys on your laptop,
  without copying them to the server. **Only to a server you trust**: while the connection is open,
  anyone with root on it — or your own account there — can use your laptop's keys to sign in
  wherever they work. On a shared or untrusted box, give the server its own deploy key instead.

## Logging the agents in on the server

The agents run on the server, so they need their own logins there. None of them needs a browser
on the server.

| What | How |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Run `claude` once — in a Shell cell, or over SSH. With no browser on the server it prints a sign-in URL ("Browser didn't open? Use the url below to sign in") and waits for a code: open the URL on your laptop, sign in, and paste the code back. On Linux the login is kept in a file under `~/.claude`, so it lasts. |
| **GitHub (`gh`)** | `gh auth login`, choose the web browser, and enter the one-time code it shows at `github.com/login/device` on your laptop. MulmoTerminal's own PR and issue views use this login too. |
| **`git push`** | `ssh -A` from your laptop (above — a trusted server only), or keys / a credential helper set up on the server. |
| **Codex** | `codex` on the server, with its own login. *Not tried yet.* |

Only the Claude Code sign-in URL was seen in the trial run — the sign-in was not completed there.

## In Docker

Run the server in a container, published on your machine's `127.0.0.1` only:

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:34567:34567 -e MULMOTERMINAL_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -v "$HOME/work:/home/dev/work" <an image with Node, git, gh and your agents> \
  npx mulmoterminal@latest --no-open
```

- `MULMOTERMINAL_HOST=0.0.0.0` is needed so the published port reaches the server inside the
  container. It prints a `[security]` warning — expected: the port is published on `127.0.0.1`
  only, so it is still reachable from your machine alone. See
  [Configuration](config.html) for what that setting allows.
- Give the container the agents' logins as **volumes**, not baked into the image — `~/.claude`,
  `~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.gitconfig`, and `~/.mulmoterminal` for
  MulmoTerminal's own state.
- On a remote Docker host, combine the two: publish on the host's `127.0.0.1`, and tunnel to the
  host with `ssh -L`.

There is no official image yet.

## What works differently

Everything in the grid works: terminals, tmux reattach, worktrees, the PR and issue views,
clipboard, sounds, pasting screenshots, and dropping files in Chrome (the file is uploaded to the
server). A few actions act on **the server's machine**, not yours:

| Action | On a Linux server with no screen | On a remote Mac |
|---|---|---|
| Reveal in the file manager, open with the OS app | Fails with an error | Opens on the **remote** screen |
| The file dialog ("Insert a file path") | Fails with an install hint | Opens on the **remote** screen |
| Voice input | Not offered (it needs the Mac-only transcriber) | Transcribes on the server |
| Dropping a file in Safari or Firefox | Inserts **your laptop's** path, which the server does not have | Same |
| `localhost:<port>` links on a worktree's `env` chip | Open on your laptop — forward that port too | Same |
| Linking Google Calendar | The sign-in redirect lands on your laptop, not the server | Same |

## Experimental: tell it the server is remote

Nothing can tell from the server that your browser is elsewhere — through a tunnel the connection
comes from the server itself. So say it, in the **server's** `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`:

```json
{ "remoteServer": true }
```

Then the actions in the table above that would act on the server's screen are withheld: the path
menu's *Insert a file path* and *Reveal in the file manager* and the launch form's folder button
are hidden, the same actions from a header button, a key or the Files pane say why instead, and a
dropped file is always uploaded rather than inserted as your laptop's path. Restart the server
after editing the file. This is an experiment — say how it went on
[issue #2669](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/issues/2669).

## Developing MulmoTerminal against a remote server

The server and the page can also be run apart: `yarn dev:server` on the server (Express only), and
`yarn dev:client` on your laptop (Vite only), with the tunnel on `34567` open — Vite forwards
`/api` and `/ws` to `localhost:34567`, which the tunnel carries to the server. *Not tried yet.*

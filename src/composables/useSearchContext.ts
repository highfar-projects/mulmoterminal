// A result row is one line, which is often not enough to tell whether it is the one you want. The
// surrounding lines are read HERE rather than asked of `git grep -C`, and that is the whole design
// decision: under `-z` git stops distinguishing a matched line from a context line, and the field
// that would distinguish them can be forged by a text file carrying a NUL past git's binary sniff
// window — a context line then becomes a selectable result whose text is silently cut. The search
// parser stays untouched and the context comes from an ordinary read.
//
// Which also gives the one answer no on-disk read could: the file open in the editor with unsaved
// edits is answered from the BUFFER, with no request at all.

   * arrive as key changes; teardown arrives by two paths, an explicit `stop` and scope disposal,
   * and both are wired.
   *
   * It is stated as what MAY be applied rather than as a list of what must be rejected, because
   * three review rounds each found a different way for an older answer to win: the stored one was
   * re-served when the selection came back, an arriving one won by answering last, and one
   * outlived the composable. A list of those three would have invited a fourth.
   *
   * ABORTING IS NOT THIS RULE and cannot replace it. Abort is not retroactive: a body whose
   * promise has already resolved still runs its continuation, and that continuation would reach
   * the ref. Abort saves the transfer; this decides what may be written.
   *
   * `runSearch` in FileSearch.vue carries the same guard for the same reason (#620). Its absence
   * here was the inconsistency.

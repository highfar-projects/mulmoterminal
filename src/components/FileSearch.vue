// Search the CONTENTS of the open directory (#2140) — the companion to FileFinder, which searches
// their names, and deliberately a SEPARATE component rather than a mode of it.
//
// They share a purpose and almost no mechanism. The finder fetches every path ONCE and filters in
// the browser on each keystroke; there is no version of this where the browser holds every file's
// text, so a search here is one server request per query, debounced, with the previous one aborted.
// The rows differ too: a file heading with its matching lines under it, not one row per path.
//
// The one file the disk cannot answer for is the one open in the editor with unsaved edits. Its
// disk matches are DISCARDED rather than merged in both modes — the two describe different
// documents, and a stale line number sends the jump to the wrong place. In literal mode the buffer
// is then searched here from its text; in regex mode it is not searched at all, because that means
// running an untrusted pattern on the thread that draws the UI, and the panel says so
// (common/fileSearch.ts carries the measurement).
//
// What a row SHOWS is decided in `searchResultView.ts` rather than here (#2159): where the query
// matched, whether the line has to be scrolled for the match to be on screen, and what the whole
// list adds up to. The lines AROUND the selected match come from `useSearchContext`.

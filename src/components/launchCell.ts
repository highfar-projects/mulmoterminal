// Each kind is already expressible as a cell: a shell is a shell launcher, a non-Claude agent is
// marked with `agent`, and Claude is the plain default. The session id arrives from the server once
// the cell opens its socket, so they all persist and reconnect like any other cell.
//
// `autoStart` is what makes an agent cell RUN. Without it these are indistinguishable from the
// empty launcher — no session, no command, no launcher — so the phone's request (#831) opened the
// cell-creation form with the agent pre-picked and waited for someone at the desktop to press
// Start, which is exactly what #1535 reported. A shell needs none of it: its launcher runs on sight.
//
// A Record over LAUNCH_AGENTS rather than an if-chain: the chain ended in `shellCell`, so adding an
// agent to that list without a case here silently opened a SHELL under its name. Now it does not
// compile.

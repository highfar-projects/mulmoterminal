// mean the same thing to the grid: one zooms this cell, the other retires it (#646 B3).
//
// What "close" DOES stays with the parent: TerminalCell's may hold a live session, so its
// handler confirms before tearing down. This emits the intent and never acts on it, so a

// No `.stop` on the clicks: the enclosing header's zoom gesture already ignores anything
// inside a button (shouldZoomOnHeaderClick), and stopping here would only hide that.

  canvasAvailable?: boolean;
  // Whether this cell's directory has the collection tools — the `data` MCP group, which is what

  // below, because Vue casts an ABSENT boolean prop to `false`: `parked === undefined` is never
  // true, so a guard written that way rendered the button on every cell type, including the
  // command and launcher cells, whose event binding deliberately omits `toggle-park` — so it

  // the button would set a state nobody sees until they leave, which reads as a broken control.

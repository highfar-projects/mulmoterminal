//
// The PROMPT and REPLY merge — an absent value keeps whatever is on screen. Both fall back to
// the transcript, which can transiently miss, and blanking every row on the first poll that
// comes up empty would strip the cockpit exactly when the user is scanning it to decide which
// of nine agents to look at. A session that HAS none sends "" (what `/clear` writes), and an
// empty string is a value — it merges through and clears the row.
//
// `aiTitle` has no transcript fallback: it is ours, held in memory, so a successful fetch
// answers it outright and `null` means "there is none now" rather than "no news". Merging it
// like the text is how a `/clear`ed session kept showing the title of the conversation the user
// had just ended (#1085) — the server had already dropped it. Same rule as applyActivityPush.
//
// `memo` follows aiTitle, not the text, and for the same reason: it lives only in the server's
// memo map, so a successful fetch answers it outright and `null` is the user having ERASED it.
// Merged like the prompt, a memo the user just cleared comes back on the next poll.
//
// `agentTitle` is taken AS-IS, with `aiTitle`, `workPhase` and `collection` — not merged with the
// text. The server memoizes it per RESOLVED CONVERSATION, so a successful fetch is authoritative;
// and merging it was wrong in the one case the resolved-conversation key exists for, a cell resumed
// onto another conversation under the same session id, where the old title outlived the switch.
//
// `workPhase` is taken AS-IS, including null, because a successful fetch is authoritative for
// it: null means "no tools yet / not working", which is a real state. Merge it like the text
// and a finished agent keeps a "planning" badge forever.
//
// `collection` follows workPhase for a different reason: it cannot change over a session's life,
// so every successful fetch for an id carries the same answer and there is nothing a merge could
// preserve. Taking it as-is is what lets a row stop wearing a mark when the cell changes session.

# Handover

Write `README.md` in the spec's language, for someone who is not an engineer:

1. What the app does, in two sentences, and where it is published (the URL in `.blueprint/deploy-url`).
2. Running it on this computer: start Docker Desktop, `yarn install` once, then `yarn start`, then the address to
   open, and the local test accounts from the seed. `yarn supabase stop` stops the local stack when you are done.
3. Publishing a change: try it with `yarn start` first. A change to the data's shape is a new migration
   (`yarn supabase migration new <name>`), applied to production with `yarn supabase db push`; then `yarn deploy`
   publishes the screen.
4. The data: it is in the Supabase project. Back it up with
   `yarn supabase db dump --linked --data-only -f backup.sql` (and the schema with `yarn supabase db dump --linked -f schema.sql`),
   and how to restore it.
5. Who can open it and sign in (anyone with the URL; who may register), and how to change that.

Then write `.blueprint/start-here.md`, in the spec's language — what the person sees the moment the build finishes:

1. **Open it** — the published URL, and who can sign in and how.
2. **Check that it works** — one checkbox per must-have in the spec, each an action and what should happen
   (`- [ ] 本を 1 冊登録する → 一覧に出る`), with the app's real screen and button names; one for someone who should be
   refused being refused (another account cannot see the first one's rows).
3. **The next change** — try it with `yarn start`, then `yarn supabase db push` for a schema change and `yarn deploy`.
4. **Your data** — the one-line backup, and where the security review is (`.blueprint/security-review.md`).

Done when the check passes: the README explains `yarn start`, `yarn deploy` and `supabase db dump`, and
`.blueprint/start-here.md` names the published URL and has the checklist.

## Always

- Read `.blueprint/spec.md` first. It is the agreed specification; do not widen it.
- When you need a decision, ask it through the blueprint question tool and stop. Do not guess.
- Do not run `git init`: a new repository loses the folder's trust and the next unattended step stops at Claude
  Code's trust prompt. The user adds git themselves after the build if they want it.
- Say you are done by stopping; the executor runs the check. Do not claim success yourself.
